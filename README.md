# SmartPhone_data
R code for tidying the course project data.


*Code Explanation:*

A R script called run_analysis.R was created that does the following: 

1.)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set called final_set.

2.)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement into a data frame called req_dataset. 

3.)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4.)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names by removing the special charaters and fixing the duplicate name issue. 

5.)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject into a daat frame called new_data5.
